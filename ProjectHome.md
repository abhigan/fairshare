fairshare is a solution to distribute the internet download bandwidth equally among peers in a small (home/hostel) network. every now and then we find users complaining of their roommates. we have one person consuming all the bandwidth by using torrents and the other person cannot even play online games. fairshare will distrubte bandwidth equally for them. the bandwidth will be distributed equally among all the users online at a perticular time. when there is only one online like at night, he gets the full share. when there are two, both get half.
